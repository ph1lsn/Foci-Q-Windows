FociQ is a python written application to quantify nuclear foci in cells. This is the **Windows executable** repository. If you are looking for the Python version, check here: (https://github.com/ph1lsn/Foci-Q). It uses ImageJ to process given images containing foci. The images may contain multiple cells/nuclei which must be marked in the **blue** channel, foci are quantified using the **green** channel of the image. The **images must be multichannel**, images containing only a single channel must be merged before use. Supported file types are .jpg and .tif! **For installation and usage refer to the UserGuide.pdf in the repo.**
